# Athena
Athena is an iOS app that allows you to track the books you are currently reading. With a simple UI and powerful features, you can easily get into the habit of reading with daily reminders and a clear view of the progress you are making on the books you are reading. You can also store the different books you have read along with the books you hope to read in the future. Furthermore, Athena allows you to take notes about what you've read.

This app was built by Sai Kambampati, Logan Thompson, Nitya Bhupatiraju, Kevin Crawford, and Leejin Kim as a part of the University of California, Santa Cruz CSE 115A: Introduction to Software Engineering course taught by Professor Richard Jullig
